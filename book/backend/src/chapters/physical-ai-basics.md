# Physical AI Basics

Most AI today lives **inside computers**:

- It answers questions in a chat.
- It generates images or code.
- It stays inside the digital world.

**Physical AI** is different.

Physical AI means:

> AI that can **sense**, **decide**, and **act** in the **real, physical world**.

## Key ideas of Physical AI

### 1. Embodiment

An AI system is *embodied* when it has:

- A **body** (robot, arm, drone, rover, etc.)
- **Sensors** (camera, microphone, touch, depth, etc.)
- **Actuators** (motors, wheels, grippers, joints)

The AI does not just think.  
It **feels**, **moves**, and **changes** the world.

### 2. Perception → Decision → Action loop

Physical AI systems run in a continuous loop:

1. **Perception** – sensing the world  
   - Cameras capture images  
   - Microphones capture sound  
   - Sensors measure distance, force, etc.

2. **Decision** – thinking about what to do  
   - AI models understand the situation  
   - Plan the next step or sequence of actions

3. **Action** – executing in the real world  
   - Move joints  
   - Walk forward  
   - Pick an object  
   - Press a button  

This loop runs **many times per second**.

### 3. Why Physical AI is hard

Physical AI is harder than pure digital AI because:

- The real world is **messy** (lighting, noise, obstacles).
- Sensors are **imperfect** (blur, delay, errors).
- Actions have **consequences** (falling, collisions, damage).
- Time matters — the robot must respond **fast**, not minutes later.

So we must design systems that are:

- **Robust** – can handle noise and uncertainty  
- **Safe** – avoid harming people or breaking things  
- **Reliable** – can repeat tasks again and again

## Examples of Physical AI systems

Some real-world examples:

- A robot arm that picks and sorts objects on a conveyor belt.
- A warehouse robot that moves boxes from one rack to another.
- A home robot that can navigate rooms and bring items.
- A humanoid robot that can walk, balance, and use tools.

All of these require:

- Sensors  
- AI models  
- Control software  
- Hardware working together.
