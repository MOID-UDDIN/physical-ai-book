# Projects and Skills

This chapter focuses on **what students should be able to do** after using this textbook.

The goal is not only to understand concepts, but to build **real, demonstrable skills**.

---

## Example project themes

Some example project directions:

- **Perception + Action**  
  - Detect objects with a camera.  
  - Use a robot arm or mobile base to interact with them.  

- **Navigation in human spaces**  
  - Move through a simple environment.  
  - Avoid obstacles.  
  - Reach target locations.  

- **Human–robot interaction**  
  - Use voice or gestures to command a robot.  
  - Provide feedback through speech, lights, or displays.  

- **LLM-powered control**  
  - Use a language model to plan multi-step tasks.  
  - Translate natural language goals into robot actions.

## Skills checklist

By the end of the course, a student should:

- Understand what **Physical AI** and **embodiment** mean.  
- Explain the basic structure of a **humanoid robot**.  
- Describe the role of **ROS 2** as a robot software backbone.  
- Use **simulation tools** to test robot behavior.  
- Understand basic **lab hardware** requirements.  
- Design or implement at least one **end-to-end project**:
  - from sensing  
  - to decision  
  - to action

## How to use this book for teaching

For instructors:

- Each chapter can map to **1–2 weeks** of teaching.  
- Simulations can be used where hardware is limited.  
- Group projects can focus on different parts of the stack:
  - perception  
  - control  
  - AI planning  
  - lab infrastructure  

For students:

- Treat each chapter as a **step** in building a complete mental model.  
- Revisit earlier chapters as concepts connect together.  
- Use projects to demonstrate your skills to employers or research labs.
