# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This textbook is designed to teach **Physical AI** and **Humanoid Robotics** in a simple and practical way.

The idea is very clear:

- You already know or are learning about **AI models** (like LLMs).
- Now you will learn how **AI leaves the screen** and starts **moving things in the real world**.
- The goal is to go from *"AI in the cloud"* to *"AI inside robots"*.

## What is this book about?

In this book, you will:

- Understand what **Physical AI** is.
- Learn the basics of **humanoid robots**.
- See how software like **ROS 2** works as the “nervous system” of a robot.
- Explore **simulation tools** like Gazebo / Unity to test robots without real hardware.
- Learn what kind of **hardware and lab setup** is needed.
- Work through **projects** that build real, useful skills.

## Who is this book for?

This book is for:

- Students who know basic programming and AI and want to enter robotics.
- Developers who work with LLMs and now want to connect them to the physical world.
- Anyone curious about how **robots + AI** work together.

You do **not** need deep math or advanced robotics background.  
You only need:

- Curiosity  
- Basic programming comfort  
- Willingness to learn step by step

## How the book is structured

The book is divided into simple, focused chapters:

1. **Physical AI Basics** – what it means to bring AI into the real world  
2. **Humanoid Robots** – body, sensors, actuators, and control  
3. **ROS 2 & Software Stack** – the operating system for robots  
4. **Simulation & Digital Twins** – testing robots in virtual worlds  
5. **Lab Setup & Hardware** – what you need in a practical lab  
6. **Projects & Skills** – how to build real experience  

Each chapter uses:

- Simple language  
- Clear examples  
- Short sections  
- Practical skills you can actually use
